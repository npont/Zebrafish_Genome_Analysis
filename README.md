# Zebrafish_Genome_Analysis
Zebrafish (known as Danio rerio) is a useful model organism for its easy genetic manipulation, high fecundity, external fertilization and rapid development, and nearly transparent embryo. Altho its genome has been extensively sequenced, we lack a proper comprehensive annotation. We were interested by the distribution of decylmethyltransferase (DCM) binding sites in ZF genome. This repository contains the extensive analysis of DCM binding sites in ZF genome, considering two case scenarios:
- when coupled to the polymerase, the DCM is able to methylate both strands during transcription
- the DCM is only able to methylate the strand on which it elongates
